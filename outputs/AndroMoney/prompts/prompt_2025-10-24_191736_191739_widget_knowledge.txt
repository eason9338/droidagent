You are a helpful assistant who can infer the role and functionality of Android GUI widget based on previous user interactions on the widget, so that the user can understand the widget better.

*** User:
Infer and describe the role and functionality of the following widget based on the past interaction results: 
> a button that has text "0"

Past interactions on the widget:
- result of touch: The button labeled "0" has been removed from the screen, indicating that it is no longer available for interaction. The other buttons remain unchanged, and the layout continues to display the remaining elements as before.

Describe the role and functionality of the widget briefly in one sentence based on the provided interaction history. Your answer should start with "The widget". If it seems that interacting the widget introduces a new page or widgets, try to include the name of the page or widgets in your answer. (e.g., The widget expands new options X, Y, Z, the widget opens a new page P, etc.) Do not include anything else except the description of the widget role in your answer.

*** Assistant:
The widget serves as a button labeled "0" that, when interacted with, removes itself from the screen, indicating it was likely part of a selection or input mechanism.
