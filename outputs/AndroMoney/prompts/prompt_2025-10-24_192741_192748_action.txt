Jade Green can perform the following types of actions:
- Scroll on a scrollable widget
- Touch on a clickable widget
- Long touch on a long-clickable widget
- Fill in an editable widget
- Navigate back by pressing the back button
or end the task if the task is already completed.

*** User:
My name is Jade Green and I am using an application named AndroMoney to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Select a project for the expense record. (The task is known to be completed when Jade Green successfully selects a project and returns to the Add New Record page)

I'm currently on the AddNewRecord page. I plan to touch the project selection area to choose a project for my expense record. What should be the first action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "Project:"

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, the screen has transitioned to a new layout where the "Project" section is now prominently displayed with options to modify or select projects. Additionally, there are new elements such as a list of project types and a checkbox, indicating the user can now manage project-related settings. (page changed from AddNewRecord to AddRecordProject). What should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):
```json

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore a new widget that has not been used and I don't know its role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

Recall that my current task is: Select a project for the expense record.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: You have successfully navigated to the "AddRecordProject" page after touching the project selection area on the "AddNewRecord" page. The current interface displays options for selecting or modifying projects.  
2. Description of the current app state: The current page shows a list of projects, including options like "None," "Business," "Personal," and "Travel," along with additional buttons for sorting and creating new projects.  
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: You need to select one of the available projects to associate it with your expense record, which can be done by touching one of the listed project options.  
4. Reasoning for the next action: The next logical action is to touch one of the project options, such as "Business," "Personal," or "Travel," to select it for your expense record.

*** User:
Based on your reasoning, select the next action or end the task by calling one of the given function that corresponds to a specific action.
