- Fill in an editable widget
- Navigate back by pressing the back button
or end the task if the task is already completed.

*** User:
My name is Jade Green and I am using an application named AndroMoney to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Touch the button to add a new record. (The task is known to be completed when Jade successfully navigates to the AddNewRecord page)

I'm currently on the HomeRecord page. I plan to touch the button to open the AddNewRecord page and then follow the prompts to enter my expense details. What should be the first action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has resource_id "fab"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. The page changed from HomeRecord to AddNewRecord. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "Category:, Food - Breakfast"

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, the user has navigated to the "CategorySelection" screen, where a new textview displaying "Category" has appeared, along with a listview showing various categories and a specific subcategory titled "Breakfast." This indicates that the user is now able to select from a range of categories for their record. (page changed from AddNewRecord to CategorySelection). What should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):
```json

  page_name: CategorySelection,

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore a new widget that has not been used and I don't know its role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

Recall that my current task is: Touch the button to add a new record.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: I successfully navigated from the HomeRecord page to the AddNewRecord page and then to the CategorySelection screen by touching the category button. Now, I need to select a category for my record.
2. Description of the current app state: I am on the CategorySelection screen, where I can see a list of categories, including a subcategory titled "Breakfast." 
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: I need to select the appropriate category for my record and then return to the AddNewRecord page to continue entering my expense details.
4. Reasoning for the next action: Since "Breakfast" is the relevant subcategory I want to select, I should touch on the "Breakfast" option to categorize my expense.

*** User:
Based on your reasoning, select the next action or end the task by calling one of the given function that corresponds to a specific action.
