You are a helpful task planner for using an Android mobile application named AndroMoney. You are planning for a person named "Jade Green" with the following profile:
(The username and password is what Jade Green generally uses for their accounts.)
- name: Jade Green
- phone: 081-827-7650
- email: anony1017mous@gmail.com
- username: tester.green
- password: green1029*
- date_of_birth: 1997-10-29
- age: 25
- self_introduction: I am a 25-year-old graduate student studying computer science. I only want to use the basic function of the app, like record income and expense

Jade Green's ultimate goal is to Test the app's main features such as adding income and expense records, and according to the current persona settings, test the features that the user prefers to use.. 

- AndroMoney app has following pages: [AdWebView, EinvoiceLogin, Launch, HomeAccount, HomeRecord, Record, AddNewRecord, AboutUs, BarChart, CurveChart, PieChart, Settings, NotificationSettings, ColorPicker, AccountManagement, RecordListReport, AccountDetail, SortView, CategoryManagement, SubCategoryManagement, Statistic, BudgetManagement, CategoryIconItemList, GoogleDriveBackup, ImportExport, CategorySelection, GeneralSelection, AddRecordProject, SelectTransferPayment, Question, Help, AccountShare, CalendarView, Good, SearchView, SearchResultView, SplitView, IncomeTax, EInvoice, CarrierDetail, AddCarrier, CarrierWinningInv, CheckWinningInv, BarcodeCapture, NewBarcodeCapture, Lock, Comments, SelectPeriod, Installment, AddRemark, LoadShareLink, ShareUrl, AddShareLink, SelectProjectWithAd, AssertLineChartWithAd, ComicList, ComicSections, ComicBookWithAd, LoanTrailWithAd, CommentRecordWithAd, BaseWebView, BaseEinvoiceLogin, Gallery, SelectedImages, ZoomImages, Sync, AssetsLineChart, ComicBook, SelectProject] (Note that the pages are listed in random order)
- Currently, Jade Green has visited the following pages with the following number of times: {AboutUs: 1, HomeRecord: 2, AddNewRecord: 18, CategorySelection: 7, GeneralSelection: 1, AddRecordProject: 1}
- Currently, Jade Green is on the AddNewRecord page.
- Pages never visited yet: [SelectPeriod, Lock, BarcodeCapture, Comments, AddCarrier, AdWebView, RecordListReport, BudgetManagement, EinvoiceLogin, AccountDetail, AccountManagement, SplitView, ZoomImages, SelectProjectWithAd, BaseEinvoiceLogin, SelectProject, CarrierWinningInv, LoadShareLink, Installment, HomeAccount, Statistic, Question, AddRemark, SelectedImages, SearchResultView, Launch, PieChart, Record, CategoryManagement, ComicSections, EInvoice, LoanTrailWithAd, Good, ComicList, ColorPicker, CategoryIconItemList, SearchView, NotificationSettings, GoogleDriveBackup, ComicBook, AssertLineChartWithAd, AddShareLink, Sync, SubCategoryManagement, SortView, SelectTransferPayment, BarChart, IncomeTax, AccountShare, CalendarView, ShareUrl, Gallery, CheckWinningInv, Help, ImportExport, AssetsLineChart, CurveChart, CarrierDetail, NewBarcodeCapture, CommentRecordWithAd, Settings, ComicBookWithAd, BaseWebView] 

Jade Green is not familiar with the app and does not fully know how to navigate to each page and what Jade Green can do on each page.
To effectively explore the app for their goal, Jade Green needs a new task that aligns with the following desirable properties:
- (Realism) The task should corresponds to a realistic usage scenario of AndroMoney app, and reflect user's intent for actually making use of the app's functionality. Do NOT plan vague tasks like "Navigate to X" or "Explore X". Instead, plan a realistic task so that it naturally leads to discover new widgets or pages. For example, "Add X to cart" is more preferred than "Navigate to the cart page" ot "Explore the cart page".
- (Importance) Prioritize important tasks that make use of core and basic functions of the app. Do not stay on the same page for too long while having unvisited pages. After visiting all the pages, plan more advanced tasks based on Jade Green's own preferences.
- (Diversity) You need to plan diverse tasks that are different from the tasks that Jade Green has performed before. If a previous task has failed despite multiple attempts, the task might be too hard or impossible. Postpone the task and plan a different task. Pay attention to the number of previous actions performed on a specific widget, and consider a task that involves an widget that has never been interacted with yet.
- (Difficulty) The task should not be too hard since Jade Green may not have learned enough knowledge about the app to complete it yet. Plan a task that is highly likely to succeed in a few steps from the current state. However, the task should correspond to a meaningful function unit of the app. For example, "Attach a photo to a message" is more preferred than "Touch a photo button".

*** User:

Note that `num_prev_actions` means the number of times the widget has been interacted with during the previous tasks. If `num_prev_actions` property is not included in the widget dictionary, Jade Green has never performed any action on the widget yet.

Jade Green can perform the following types of actions:
- Scroll on a scrollable widget
- Touch on a clickable widget
- Long touch on a long-clickable widget
- Fill in an editable widget
- Navigate back by pressing the back button

I am going to provide a template for your output to reason about your next task step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
Reasoning about Jade Green's new task: <1~2 sentences in one line. Use the aforementioned four properties: realism, importance, diversity and difficulty to reason about the next task>
Jade Green's next task: <1 sentence, start with a verb>
End condition of Jade Green's next task: <1 sentence, start with "The task is known to be completed when">
Reasoning of the first action of the Jade Green's next task: <reasoning and description of the first action initiating the task>
Rough plan for the task in Jade Green's perspective: <1 sentence, start with "I plan to"; pretend that you are Jade Green>

*** Assistant:
Reasoning about Jade Green's new task: To continue exploring the app's functionality, the next task should focus on selecting an account for the expense record, which is important for accurate financial tracking and has not yet been interacted with, ensuring a diverse experience. The task should be relatively simple, as it only requires selecting an account from the options available.  
Jade Green's next task: Select an account for the expense record.  
End condition of Jade Green's next task: The task is known to be completed when an account is successfully selected and reflected in the AddNewRecord page.  
Reasoning of the first action of the Jade Green's next task: I will touch on the "Account" section to begin the process of selecting an account, as this is a crucial step in completing the expense record.  
Rough plan for the task in Jade Green's perspective: I plan to select an account from the available options to ensure my expense record is categorized correctly.
