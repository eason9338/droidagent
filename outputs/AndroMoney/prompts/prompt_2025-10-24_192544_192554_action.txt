- Touch on a clickable widget
- Long touch on a long-clickable widget
- Fill in an editable widget
- Navigate back by pressing the back button
or end the task if the task is already completed.

*** User:
My name is Jade Green and I am using an application named AndroMoney to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Select an account for the expense record. (The task is known to be completed when an account is successfully selected and reflected in the AddNewRecord page)

I'm currently on the AddNewRecord page. I plan to select an account from the available options to ensure my expense record is categorized correctly. What should be the first action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "Account:, Cash"

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, the touch on the button labeled "Account:, Cash" has resulted in the display of a new text view that states "Account" along with a secondary text view that indicates "Long press to modify." Additionally, the text view for "Cash" has been retained, indicating the focus on the account selection. (page changed from AddNewRecord to GeneralSelection). What should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):
```json

  page_name: GeneralSelection,

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore a new widget that has not been used and I don't know its role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

Recall that my current task is: Select an account for the expense record.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: I have successfully navigated to the GeneralSelection page after touching the "Account:, Cash" button on the AddNewRecord page. The focus is now on selecting an account for my expense record.
2. Description of the current app state: The GeneralSelection page displays the text "Account" and provides a list of account options, including "Cash," "Credit Card," and "Bank."
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: To complete the task, I need to select one of the available accounts from the list presented on the GeneralSelection page.
4. Reasoning for the next action: The most logical action is to touch the widget labeled "Cash" to select it as my account for the expense record since it is one of the available options.

*** User:
Based on your reasoning, select the next action or end the task by calling one of the given function that corresponds to a specific action.
