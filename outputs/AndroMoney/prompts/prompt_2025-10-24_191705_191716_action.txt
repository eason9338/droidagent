*** User:
My name is Jade Green and I am using an application named AndroMoney to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Add a new expense record. (The task is known to be completed when the expense record has been successfully saved)

I'm currently on the NexusLauncher page. What should be the first action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "AndroMoney"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "AndroMoney"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. The page changed from AboutUs to HomeRecord. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has resource_id "fab"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. The page changed from HomeRecord to AddNewRecord. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "Category:, Food - Breakfast"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. The page changed from AddNewRecord to CategorySelection. However, I got the following critique for my actions so far: 
> Criticizer: "Jade Green has successfully navigated to the Category Selection page, which is a necessary step for adding a new expense record. However, they have not yet selected a category, which is essential to complete the task. Jade Green needs to touch on one of the category options listed, such as "Food" or "Transportation," to proceed with adding the expense record." 
Considering the critique, what should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "Food"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "Breakfast"

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, after touching the button labeled "Breakfast," a new text view appears with the message "Auto fill by category," indicating that a prompt for auto-filling transactions based on the selected category has been activated. Additionally, a checkbox labeled "Ask every time" is now checked, suggesting that the user will be prompted for confirmation during future transactions. What should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):
```json
{
  page_name: CategorySelection,
  children: [
    {
      widget_type: TextView,
      text: Auto fill by category
    },
    {
      widget_type: TextView,
      text: Auto fill by category on entering transaction?
    },
    {
      ID: 13,
      widget_type: CheckBox,
      text: Ask every time,
      state: [
        checked
      ],
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      ID: 16,
      widget_type: Button,
      text: NO,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      ID: 17,
      widget_type: Button,
      text: YES,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    }
  ]
}
```

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore a new widget that has not been used and I don't know its role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

Recall that my current task is: Add a new expense record.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: Jade Green has successfully navigated to the Category Selection page and selected the "Breakfast" category, but has not yet confirmed the auto-fill setting for future transactions, which is necessary to complete the task of adding a new expense record.
2. Description of the current app state: The Category Selection page displays a prompt for auto-filling transactions based on the selected category, with the checkbox "Ask every time" checked, and two buttons labeled "NO" and "YES" available for interaction.
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: Jade Green needs to confirm the auto-fill setting by selecting either the "NO" or "YES" button to proceed with adding the expense record.
4. Reasoning for the next action: Touching the "YES" button will confirm the auto-fill setting, allowing Jade Green to finalize the expense record entry process.
