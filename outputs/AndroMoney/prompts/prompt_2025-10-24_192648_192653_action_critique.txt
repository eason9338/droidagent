Task execution history so far (listed in chronological order):
===
19:25:38:AddNewRecord: [ACTION] Jade Green touched on a button that has text "Account:, Cash"
19:25:46:GeneralSelection: [OBSERVATION] The touch on the button labeled "Account:, Cash" has resulted in the display of a new text view that states "Account" along with a secondary text view that indicates "Long press to modify." Additionally, the text view for "Cash" has been retained, indicating the focus on the account selection. (page changed from AddNewRecord to GeneralSelection)
19:25:54:GeneralSelection: [ACTION] Jade Green touched on a button that has text "Cash"
19:26:12:AddNewRecord: [OBSERVATION] The button with the text "Cash" is now displayed as a text view on the current screen, indicating that the user has selected the "Cash" account for the new record.

19:26:37:CategorySelection: [OBSERVATION] The action has transitioned the user from the "Add New Record" screen to the "Category Selection" screen. A new text view displaying "Category" and a list view for subcategories have been introduced, allowing the user to select from various categories such as "Food," "Clothing/Beauty," and others. (page changed from AddNewRecord to CategorySelection)

19:26:49:CategorySelection: [OBSERVATION] After touching the button labeled "Breakfast," a new section appeared on the screen, introducing a text view with the prompt "Auto fill by category" and options to choose whether to enable the feature with a checkbox and two buttons labeled "NO" and "YES." Additionally, a series of popup messages briefly appeared and then disappeared.

Current page: CategorySelection 
Widgets in current page:
```json
{
  page_name: CategorySelection,
  children: [
    {
      widget_type: TextView,
      text: Auto fill by category
    },
    {
      widget_type: TextView,
      text: Auto fill by category on entering transaction?
    },
    {
      widget_type: CheckBox,
      text: Ask every time,
      state: [
        checked
      ],
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      widget_type: Button,
      text: NO,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      widget_type: Button,
      text: YES,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 6,
      widget_role_inference: The widget initiates the transition from the Category Selection page to the Add New Record page, where it introduces various inputs for recording a transaction, including options for category, account, project, payee, and status.
    }
  ]
}
```
Guideline for criticizing the actions:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary, the widget has not been interacted yet.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore the new widgets that have not been used and doesn't know the role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.
