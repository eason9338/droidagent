*** User:
My name is Jade Green and I am using an application named AndroMoney to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Add a new expense record. (The task is known to be completed when the expense record has been successfully saved)

I'm currently on the NexusLauncher page. I plan to open the AndroMoney app and look for an option to add a new expense record, allowing me to familiarize myself with the app's functionality. What should be the first action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "AndroMoney"

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, after the action, the following popup message(s) were shown and soon disappeared: {'Automatically set your main currency to:USDIf this is not the main currency you use. Please go to Settings to change., AndroMoney'}. What should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):

    }

}
```

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore a new widget that has not been used and I don't know its role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

Recall that my current task is: Add a new expense record.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: I opened the AndroMoney app and dismissed a popup message about the main currency being set to USD. 
2. Description of the current app state: I am on the AboutUs page, which contains various options including the AndroMoney app, but I haven't interacted with the main content of the app yet.
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: I need to navigate to the main interface of AndroMoney to find the option to add a new expense record.
4. Reasoning for the next action: Since the AndroMoney option is available and has not been interacted with yet, the most logical action is to touch on the AndroMoney widget to proceed.

*** User:
Based on your reasoning, select the next action or end the task by calling one of the given function that corresponds to a specific action.
