*** User:
My name is Jade Green and I am using an application named AndroMoney to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Add a new expense record. (The task is known to be completed when the expense record has been successfully saved)

I'm currently on the NexusLauncher page. What should be the first action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "AndroMoney"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:

*** User:

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "0"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. However, I got the following critique for my actions so far: 
> Criticizer: "Jade Green has navigated through the app effectively and is currently on the Add New Record page, but has not yet entered the expense amount or completed the record. Jade Green needs to touch the button labeled "0" to enter the expense amount, and then touch the "SAVE" button to complete the task." 
Considering the critique, what should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "US$"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Press "BACK" button to navigate back

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "DON'T REMIND"

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, after touching the "DON'T REMIND" button, the screen now includes a new button with the resource_id "back" and additional text views that provide information about currency, indicating a transition to a different context within the application. What should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore a new widget that has not been used and I don't know its role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

Recall that my current task is: Add a new expense record.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: I have navigated to the Add New Record page and selected the category for the expense, but I have not yet entered the expense amount or saved the record. The criticizer noted that I need to enter the expense amount and save the record to complete the task.
2. Description of the current app state: I am currently on the Add New Record page, where I can see options related to currency and a button labeled "back," along with a list of currencies that I have not interacted with yet.
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: I need to enter the expense amount and then save the record to finalize the new expense entry. Exploring the currency options may also be necessary to set the correct currency for the expense.
4. Reasoning for the next action: Since I have not yet interacted with the currency list, I will long touch on the ListView with resource_id "currencylist" to explore the available currency options and select the appropriate one for my expense record.

*** User:
Based on your reasoning, select the next action or end the task by calling one of the given function that corresponds to a specific action.
