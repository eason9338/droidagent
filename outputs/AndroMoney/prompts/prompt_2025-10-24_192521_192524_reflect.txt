Guideline for the task reflection based on the task result:
- If the task is successful, provide a learned knowledge about the app functionality. (e.g., "The app supports the task X by doing Y.")
- If the task is failed and seems to be impossible to accomplish (e.g., the app does not support the task), reflect on the reason why the task is impossible to accomplish. (e.g., "Jade Green once tried to do X but couldn't do Y. It seems that the app does not support Z.")
- If the task is failed but still seems to be possible to accomplish, reflect why Jade Green failed to accomplish the task and provide lessons learned from the failure. (e.g., "Jade Green once tried to do X but couldn't do Y. It seems that Jade Green might have to do Z before doing Y.")
- The reflections will be provided to Jade Green to help planning next tasks and avoid previous mistakes. Keep the reflections to be self-contained (briefly include what the target task was) and concise.

I am going to provide a template for your output to reason about your answer step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
Summary of the task result: <1~2 sentences, summary of the result of the task>
Task done successfully?: <yes/no, do not include anything else in your answer>
Reflections on the task:
- <1 sentence for each item>
<...provide up to 3 items>

*** Assistant:
Summary of the task result: Jade Green successfully navigated through several screens to begin the process of adding a new record, including selecting a category, account, and project. However, the task was aborted before completing the record entry due to its length and complexity.  
Task done successfully?: no  
Reflections on the task:  
- The app supports the task of adding a new record by allowing users to select categories, accounts, and projects, which are essential for detailed record-keeping.  
- Jade Green encountered difficulties in completing the task due to the complexity and length of the process, indicating that breaking down tasks into smaller steps may be more effective.  
- It might be helpful for Jade Green to familiarize herself with each section of the record entry process before attempting to add a new record to ensure a smoother experience.
