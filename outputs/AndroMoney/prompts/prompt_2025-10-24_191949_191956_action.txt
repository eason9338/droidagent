*** User:
My name is Jade Green and I am using an application named AndroMoney to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Select a category for the expense record. (The task is known to be completed when Jade Green successfully chooses a category from the list)

I'm currently on the AddNewRecord page. I plan to select a category for my expense to better understand how to record my spending. What should be the first action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "Category:, Food - Breakfast"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. The page changed from AddNewRecord to CategorySelection. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "Breakfast"

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, after touching the "Breakfast" button, a new textview appeared with the text "Auto fill by category," indicating that a new option related to auto-filling transactions by category is now available. Additionally, a checkbox labeled "Ask every time" was added, allowing for further customization of the auto-fill feature. What should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):
```json
{
  page_name: CategorySelection,
  children: [
    {
      widget_type: TextView,
      text: Auto fill by category
    },
    {
      widget_type: TextView,
      text: Auto fill by category on entering transaction?
    },
    {
      ID: 13,
      widget_type: CheckBox,
      text: Ask every time,
      state: [
        checked
      ],
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      ID: 16,
      widget_type: Button,
      text: NO,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      ID: 17,
      widget_type: Button,
      text: YES,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 2,
      widget_role_inference: The widget opens a new page for adding a new record, transitioning from the Category Selection page to the Add New Record page, where users can input transaction details related to an expense.
    }
  ]
}
```

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore a new widget that has not been used and I don't know its role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

Recall that my current task is: Select a category for the expense record.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: I have successfully navigated to the CategorySelection page and selected the category "Breakfast" for my expense record. A new option for auto-filling transactions by category has appeared, along with a checkbox for further customization.
2. Description of the current app state: The CategorySelection page now features a checkbox labeled "Ask every time" and two buttons labeled "NO" and "YES," which likely lead to the next step in recording the expense.
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: To finalize the category selection for my expense record, I need to confirm my choice by interacting with one of the buttons that will transition me back to the Add New Record page.
4. Reasoning for the next action: Since I need to proceed with confirming my category selection, the most logical action is to touch the "YES" button, which is inferred to lead to the next step in adding a new record.

*** User:
Based on your reasoning, select the next action or end the task by calling one of the given function that corresponds to a specific action.
