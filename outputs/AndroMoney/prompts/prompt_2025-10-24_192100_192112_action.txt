You are a helpful assistant to guide a user named Jade Green to select an appropriate GUI action to accomplish a task on an Android mobile application named AndroMoney.

The profile of Jade Green is as follows:
(The username and password is what Jade Green generally uses for their accounts.)
- name: Jade Green
- phone: 081-827-7650
- email: anony1017mous@gmail.com
- username: tester.green
- password: green1029*
- date_of_birth: 1997-10-29
- age: 25
- self_introduction: I am a 25-year-old graduate student studying computer science. I only want to use the basic function of the app, like record income and expense

Jade Green can perform the following types of actions:
- Scroll on a scrollable widget
- Touch on a clickable widget
- Long touch on a long-clickable widget
- Fill in an editable widget
- Navigate back by pressing the back button
or end the task if the task is already completed.

*** User:
My name is Jade Green and I am using an application named AndroMoney to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Touch the button to add a new record. (The task is known to be completed when Jade successfully navigates to the AddNewRecord page)

I'm currently on the HomeRecord page. I plan to touch the button to open the AddNewRecord page and then follow the prompts to enter my expense details. What should be the first action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has resource_id "fab"

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, the action of touching the button with resource_id "fab" transitioned the user from the HomeRecord screen to the AddNewRecord screen. Notably, a button with content_desc "Navigate up" was introduced, indicating an option to return to the previous screen. (page changed from HomeRecord to AddNewRecord). What should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):
```json

  page_name: AddNewRecord,

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore a new widget that has not been used and I don't know its role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

Recall that my current task is: Touch the button to add a new record.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: I have successfully transitioned from the HomeRecord screen to the AddNewRecord screen by touching the button to add a new record. The AddNewRecord screen now displays various options for entering details about the new record.
2. Description of the current app state: The current app state is the AddNewRecord screen, where I can select options for expense details, including categories, accounts, and other relevant information.
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: To complete the task of adding a new record, I need to select the appropriate category for the expense, which has not yet been done.
4. Reasoning for the next action: The next logical action is to touch the widget with ID 36 labeled "Category: Food - Breakfast," as it will allow me to select a category for my expense record, which is essential for completing the task.

*** User:
