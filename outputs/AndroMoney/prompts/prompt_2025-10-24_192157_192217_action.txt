- name: Jade Green
- phone: 081-827-7650
- email: anony1017mous@gmail.com
- username: tester.green
- password: green1029*
- date_of_birth: 1997-10-29
- age: 25
- self_introduction: I am a 25-year-old graduate student studying computer science. I only want to use the basic function of the app, like record income and expense

Jade Green can perform the following types of actions:
- Scroll on a scrollable widget
- Touch on a clickable widget
- Long touch on a long-clickable widget
- Fill in an editable widget
- Navigate back by pressing the back button
or end the task if the task is already completed.

*** User:
My name is Jade Green and I am using an application named AndroMoney to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Touch the button to add a new record. (The task is known to be completed when Jade successfully navigates to the AddNewRecord page)

I'm currently on the HomeRecord page. What should be the first action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has resource_id "fab"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. The page changed from HomeRecord to AddNewRecord. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "Category:, Food - Breakfast"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. The page changed from AddNewRecord to CategorySelection. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "Breakfast"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "YES"

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, after touching the "YES" button, the user is taken to the "Add New Record" screen, which introduces a new layout with various buttons and text views related to recording a transaction, including options for category, account, project, payee, and status. The previous options for auto-fill and the "CategorySelection" are no longer visible. (page changed from CategorySelection to AddNewRecord). However, I got the following critique for my actions so far: 
> Criticizer: "Jade Green successfully navigated to the AddNewRecord page and has interacted with the necessary options; however, further actions are needed to complete the record entry. Jade Green needs to explore the "Account:", "Project:", "Payee:", and "Note:" fields to fill in the necessary details for the new record before saving it." 
Considering the critique, what should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore a new widget that has not been used and I don't know its role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

Recall that my current task is: Touch the button to add a new record.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: Jade Green has successfully navigated to the AddNewRecord page and interacted with the category selection, but further actions are needed to fill in the details for the new record as per the critique received. 
2. Description of the current app state: The AddNewRecord page is displayed, featuring options for entering details such as Account, Project, Payee, and Note, with some buttons and fields ready for interaction. 
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: To complete the record entry, Jade Green needs to fill in the necessary details in the Account, Project, Payee, and Note fields before saving the record. 
4. Reasoning for the next action: The next logical step is to explore the "Account:" field, which has not been interacted with yet, to specify the account for the new record.
