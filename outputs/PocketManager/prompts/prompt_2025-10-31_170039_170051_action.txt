*** User:
My name is Jade Green and I am using an application named 記帳小助手 to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Record a USD 15 lunch expense at a nearby café. (The task is known to be completed when the lunch expense is successfully recorded in the app with all relevant details filled in)

I'm currently on the Main page. What should be the first action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has resource_id "adder"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Open the app again because the previous action led to closing the app

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Press "BACK" button to navigate back

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:

*** User:

*** Assistant:

*** User:

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Jade Green pressed the back button because there was no interactable widgets

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. However, I got the following critique for my actions so far: 
> Criticizer: "Jade Green has encountered some confusion while navigating the app, leading to unnecessary backtracking instead of progressing to record the expense. Jade Green needs to focus on the "amountEditor" text field to input the amount of 15, select the appropriate asset and category using the "assetPicker" and "categoryPicker," and then press the "新增" button to save the expense." 
Considering the critique, what should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Fill a focused textfield that has resource_id "amountEditor" with "15"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Jade Green pressed the back button because there was no interactable widgets

*** User:

*** Assistant:
Touch on a dropdown field that has text "現金"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "帳戶"

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, after touching the button labeled "帳戶," a new button with the text "收入" appeared, while the previously checked button "現金" was removed. Additionally, a dropdown field labeled "資產" was introduced, indicating a change in the available options for the user. What should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- Focus on completing your SPECIFIC TASK, not exploring new widgets
- If you are stuck or confused while trying to complete the task, report the problem:
  * "I cannot find the option for [what you're looking for]"
  * "The UI is unclear about [specific confusion point]"
  * "I expected to see [something] but found [something else]"
- If the task seems impossible to complete with current UI state, explain why and suggest giving up

Recall that my current task is: Record a USD 15 lunch expense at a nearby café.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: I have attempted to record a USD 15 lunch expense but encountered confusion while navigating the app, leading to unnecessary backtracking. I filled in the amount as 15 and accessed the asset options but need to select the appropriate asset and category to complete the recording process.
2. Description of the current app state: The app is currently on the AddOrEdit page, where I can see options for asset selection, category selection, and a button to add the expense.
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: I need to select the appropriate asset from the "資產" dropdown, choose a category from the "類別" dropdown, and then press the "新增" button to save the expense.
4. Reasoning for the next action: The next logical action is to touch on the "資產" dropdown (ID 16) to select the appropriate asset for the expense.
