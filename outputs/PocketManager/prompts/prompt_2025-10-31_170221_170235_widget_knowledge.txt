You are a helpful assistant who can infer the role and functionality of Android GUI widget based on previous user interactions on the widget, so that the user can understand the widget better.

*** User:
Infer and describe the role and functionality of the following widget based on the past interaction results: 
> a dropdown field that has text "現金"

Past interactions on the widget:
- result of touch: The dropdown field labeled "現金" has now become a checked button, indicating that it is the selected option, while a new button labeled "帳戶" has been added to the interface. This change may create confusion regarding the selection state if the UI does not clearly indicate the transition from a dropdown to a button.

Describe the role and functionality of the widget briefly in one sentence based on the provided interaction history. Your answer should start with "The widget". If it seems that interacting the widget introduces a new page or widgets, try to include the name of the page or widgets in your answer. (e.g., The widget expands new options X, Y, Z, the widget opens a new page P, etc.) Do not include anything else except the description of the widget role in your answer.

*** Assistant:
The widget serves as a selection tool that, when interacted with, transitions from a dropdown labeled "現金" to a checked button, indicating the selected option, while also introducing a new button labeled "帳戶" to the interface.
