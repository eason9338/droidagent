- Fill in an editable widget
- Navigate back by pressing the back button
- End the task when your specific goal is completed

*** User:
My name is Jade Green and I am using an application named 記帳小助手 to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Record a USD 10 transport expense by selecting the 交通 category, entering the amount, and adding a note about the trip. (The task is known to be completed when the transport expense is successfully recorded, showing the amount and category in the expense list)

I'm currently on the AddOrEdit page. I plan to record a transport expense of USD 10 by selecting the 交通 category, entering the amount, and adding a note to keep track of my daily commuting costs. What should be the first action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "交通"

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, the button labeled "交通" remains visible, but several new widgets have appeared, including a "backButton," a "收入" button, and a selected button labeled "支出." Additionally, new text views and dropdown fields have been introduced, indicating a change in the available options and context for the user. What should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):
```json

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- Focus on completing your SPECIFIC TASK, not exploring new widgets
- If you are stuck or confused while trying to complete the task, report the problem:
  * "I cannot find the option for [what you're looking for]"
  * "The UI is unclear about [specific confusion point]"
  * "I expected to see [something] but found [something else]"
- If the task seems impossible to complete with current UI state, explain why and suggest giving up

Recall that my current task is: Record a USD 10 transport expense by selecting the 交通 category, entering the amount, and adding a note about the trip.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: I have selected the 交通 category for my transport expense and am now on the AddOrEdit page, ready to input the amount and add a note. 
2. Description of the current app state: The page now contains fields for entering the amount and a note, along with options for selecting the account and category, with the 支出 button selected.
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: I need to enter the amount of USD 10 in the amount field and add a note about the trip before finalizing the expense.
4. Reasoning for the next action: I should fill in the amount field with the correct value to record the transport expense accurately.

*** Assistant:
Role of the textfield: The textfield is for entering the amount of the transport expense.  
Reasoning for generating proper text: Jade Green needs to input the amount of USD 10 for the transport expense accurately.  
Text: 10
