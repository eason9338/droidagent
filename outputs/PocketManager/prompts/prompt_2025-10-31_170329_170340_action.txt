Jade Green can perform the following types of actions:

*** User:
My name is Jade Green and I am using an application named 記帳小助手 to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Record a USD 15 lunch expense by selecting the cash account, choosing the food category, entering the amount, and adding a note. (The task is known to be completed when the USD 15 lunch expense is successfully recorded and appears in the expense list)

I'm currently on the AddOrEdit page. I plan to select the cash account, choose the food category, enter the amount of 15, add a note for the expense, and finally submit the entry to record my lunch expense. What should be the first action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a dropdown field that has text "現金"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "帳戶"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a dropdown field that has text "食物"

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, the dropdown field labeled "類別" has been expanded to show additional options, and the button labeled "食物" is now checked, indicating that it has been selected as the current category. Other category options such as "交通," "運動," "生活用品," and "其他" are now visible for selection. What should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):
```json
{
  page_name: AddOrEdit,
  children: [
    {
      ID: 3,
      widget_type: CheckedTextView,
      text: 食物,
      state: [
        checked
      ],
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 2,
      widget_role_inference: The widget toggles the selection of 食物, and when deselected, it introduces new elements on the screen, including a button for 收入, a selected button for 支出, and various text fields and dropdowns related to the entry form.
    },
    {
      ID: 4,
      widget_type: CheckedTextView,
      text: 交通,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      ID: 5,
      widget_type: CheckedTextView,
      text: 運動,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      ID: 6,
      widget_type: CheckedTextView,
      text: 生活用品,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      ID: 7,
      widget_type: CheckedTextView,
      text: 其他,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    }
  ]
}
```

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- Focus on completing your SPECIFIC TASK, not exploring new widgets
- If you are stuck or confused while trying to complete the task, report the problem:
  * "I cannot find the option for [what you're looking for]"
  * "The UI is unclear about [specific confusion point]"
  * "I expected to see [something] but found [something else]"
- If the task seems impossible to complete with current UI state, explain why and suggest giving up

Recall that my current task is: Record a USD 15 lunch expense by selecting the cash account, choosing the food category, entering the amount, and adding a note.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: I have selected the cash account and chosen the food category for my lunch expense. The category "食物" is currently checked, indicating that it has been successfully selected.
2. Description of the current app state: The dropdown for the category has expanded, showing that "食物" is selected, and there are additional options available but no further actions have been taken.
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: I need to enter the amount of 15, add a note for the expense, and then submit the entry to record the lunch expense.
4. Reasoning for the next action: The next logical step is to fill in the amount for the expense, which is an essential part of completing the task.
