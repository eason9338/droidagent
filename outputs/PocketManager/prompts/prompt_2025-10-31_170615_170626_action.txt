- user_segment: "Power User"
- typical_tasks: ["Add expense in different currencies", "Generate expense reports", "Manage multiple accounts"]

- task_completion_rule: Each task is ONE COMPLETE workflow from start to finish. Do NOT split a workflow into multiple separate tasks. Do NOT repeat the same workflow multiple times unless testing different variations.

CRITICAL: Your role is to help Jade Green COMPLETE the planned task, not to explore the app randomly.
- You have a specific goal to achieve
- You must work directly toward this goal
- Do NOT try alternative options or explore unrelated features unless necessary
- When you encounter choices, pick the one that matches your goal

Jade Green can perform the following types of actions:
- Scroll on a scrollable widget

- Fill in an editable widget
- Navigate back by pressing the back button
- End the task when your specific goal is completed

*** User:
My name is Jade Green and I am using an application named 記帳小助手 to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Record a USD 10 transport expense by selecting the 交通 category, entering the amount, and adding a note about the trip. (The task is known to be completed when the transport expense is successfully recorded, showing the amount and category in the expense list)

I'm currently on the AddOrEdit page. What should be the first action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "交通"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Fill a focused textfield that has text "15" with "10"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Jade Green pressed the back button because there was no interactable widgets

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Fill a textfield that has resource_id "noteEditor" with "Daily commute to university"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Jade Green pressed the back button because there was no interactable widgets

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "新增"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. The page changed from AddOrEdit to Main. However, I got the following critique for my actions so far: 
> Criticizer: "Jade Green has successfully selected the transport category, entered the amount, and added a note; however, pressing the back button has caused them to exit the expense entry screen, preventing the task from being completed. Jade Green needs to navigate back to the AddOrEdit screen by touching the adder button and then complete the expense entry by pressing the "新增" button to record the transport expense." 
Considering the critique, what should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has resource_id "adder"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. The page changed from Main to AddOrEdit. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a dropdown field that has text "食物"

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, the dropdown field labeled "類別" has been expanded to reveal additional options, and the button labeled "食物" is now checked, indicating that it has been selected as the current category. Other available options such as "交通," "運動," "生活用品," and "其他" are also displayed for selection. What should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):
```json
{
  page_name: AddOrEdit,
  children: [
    {
      ID: 3,
      widget_type: CheckedTextView,
      text: 食物,
      state: [
        checked
      ],
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 2,
      widget_role_inference: The widget allows the user to select or deselect the category 食物, which, when interacted with, introduces new options including a button for 收入, a selected button for 支出, and various text fields and dropdowns related to the entry form.
    },
    {
      ID: 4,
      widget_type: CheckedTextView,
      text: 交通,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 2,
      widget_role_inference: The widget expands new options including a backButton, an 收入 button, and a selected button labeled 支出, indicating it is likely part of a financial management interface for tracking transportation-related expenses.
    },
    {
      ID: 5,
      widget_type: CheckedTextView,
      text: 運動,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      ID: 6,
      widget_type: CheckedTextView,
      text: 生活用品,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      ID: 7,
      widget_type: CheckedTextView,
      text: 其他,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    }
  ]
}
```

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- Focus on completing your SPECIFIC TASK, not exploring new widgets
- If you are stuck or confused while trying to complete the task, report the problem:
  * "I cannot find the option for [what you're looking for]"
  * "The UI is unclear about [specific confusion point]"
  * "I expected to see [something] but found [something else]"
- If the task seems impossible to complete with current UI state, explain why and suggest giving up

Recall that my current task is: Record a USD 10 transport expense by selecting the 交通 category, entering the amount, and adding a note about the trip.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: I have successfully navigated back to the AddOrEdit screen, selected the transport category, and entered the amount. However, I need to ensure that the correct category is selected before completing the entry.
2. Description of the current app state: The dropdown field labeled "類別" is expanded, with the category "食物" currently checked and other options such as "交通," "運動," "生活用品," and "其他" available for selection.
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: I need to select the "交通" category, enter the amount of USD 10, and add a note about the trip before pressing the button to record the expense.
4. Reasoning for the next action: I should touch on the "交通" option to ensure the correct category is selected for the expense recording.
