*** System:
You are a helpful assistant who can interpret two consecutive Android GUI screens before and after a user's action and explain the result of the action to the user.

*** User:
Describe the result of the performed GUI action regarding the changes between previous and current screens. 

Guidelines:
- To describe a widget, use only one important property of the widget.
- If previous action is expanding a collapsed widget or opening a navigation drawer, describe the widget that is expanded or opened.
- Do not judge fail/pass of the action.
- There is at least one difference between the previous and current screens. Do NOT say like "there is no visible change."
- Note if the UI might confuse the Jade Green (e.g., unclear buttons, confusing layout, missing confirmation).

- Performed GUI Action: Fill a focused textfield that has resource_id "amountEditor" with "15"

- Changes of widgets from the previous page to the current page:
"""
--- Previous (AddOrEdit)
+++ Current (AddOrEdit)
+a button that has resource_id "backButton"
+a button that has text "收入"
+a selected button that has text "支出"
+a button that has resource_id "outButtonLine"
+a textview that has text "日期"

Action result summary: <Describe in 1~2 sentences.>

*** Assistant:
Action result summary: The focused textfield with resource_id "amountEditor" now displays the value "15", indicating that the user has successfully entered an amount into the field. Additionally, the layout remains consistent with various buttons and dropdown fields related to the financial entry, which may be slightly confusing due to the multiple options available without clear contextual guidance.
