Task execution history so far (listed in chronological order):
===
16:57:55:Main: [ACTION] Jade Green touched on a button that has resource_id "adder"
16:58:30:Main: [ACTION] Open the app again because the previous action led to closing the app
16:58:33:Main: [OBSERVATION] After touching the button with resource_id "adder," a new button with text "Fri, Oct 31" appeared on the screen, along with several additional buttons and widgets such as "Play Store," "Gmail," and "Photos." The previous textview indicating "還沒有資料喔~" and other financial summary widgets are no longer visible, suggesting a shift to a different interface or functionality.
16:58:40:Main: [ACTION] Jade Green pressed "BACK" button to navigate back
16:58:58:Main: [ACTION] Open the app again because the previous action led to closing the app
16:59:00:Main: [OBSERVATION] After pressing the "BACK" button, the current screen now displays a text view with the message "還沒有資料喔~" indicating that no data is available, along with several buttons and text views related to financial tracking, which were not present on the previous screen. This change may be confusing for users as it shifts from a main app interface to a more specific financial summary without clear context.
16:59:04:Main: [ACTION] Jade Green touched on a button that has resource_id "adder"
16:59:13:AddOrEdit: [OBSERVATION] The action of touching the button with resource_id "adder" has transitioned the user from the main screen to the AddOrEdit screen, where new input fields and options for entering financial data are now available, including dropdowns for asset and category selection, as well as text fields for amount and notes. Additionally, a back button has been introduced for navigation back to the previous screen. (page changed from Main to AddOrEdit)
16:59:16:AddOrEdit: [ACTION] Jade Green touched on a textfield that has resource_id "amountEditor"
16:59:29:com.mark.pocketmanager/.Home.AddOrEditActivity: [ACTION] Jade Green pressed the back button because there was no interactable widgets
16:59:32:AddOrEdit: [OBSERVATION] The textfield with resource_id "amountEditor" is now focused, allowing the user to input or edit the amount. Additionally, the current screen displays various buttons and textviews related to the transaction details, indicating an active interface for entering financial information.

Guideline for criticizing the actions:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary, the widget has not been interacted yet.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore the new widgets that have not been used and doesn't know the role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

I am going to provide a template for your output to reason about your choice step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
Critique of task execution so far: <1~2 sentences in one line, say "okay" if everything seems fine.>
Need a workaround plan?: <yes/no, do not include any other word except "yes" or "no">
Workaround plan for Jade Green: <Start with "Jade Green needs to", and describe in one line. Say just "none" if Jade Green is doing well and no workaround is needed.>

*** Assistant:
Critique of task execution so far: Jade Green has encountered some confusion while navigating the app, leading to unnecessary backtracking instead of progressing to record the expense. 
Need a workaround plan?: yes
Workaround plan for Jade Green: Jade Green needs to focus on the "amountEditor" text field to input the amount of 15, select the appropriate asset and category using the "assetPicker" and "categoryPicker," and then press the "新增" button to save the expense.
