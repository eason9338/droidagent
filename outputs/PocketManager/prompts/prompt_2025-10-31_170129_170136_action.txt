- task_completion_rule: Each task is ONE COMPLETE workflow from start to finish. Do NOT split a workflow into multiple separate tasks. Do NOT repeat the same workflow multiple times unless testing different variations.

CRITICAL: Your role is to help Jade Green COMPLETE the planned task, not to explore the app randomly.
- You have a specific goal to achieve
- You must work directly toward this goal
- Do NOT try alternative options or explore unrelated features unless necessary
- When you encounter choices, pick the one that matches your goal

Jade Green can perform the following types of actions:
- Scroll on a scrollable widget
- Touch on a clickable widget
- Long touch on a long-clickable widget
- Fill in an editable widget
- Navigate back by pressing the back button
- End the task when your specific goal is completed

*** User:
My name is Jade Green and I am using an application named 記帳小助手 to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Record a USD 15 lunch expense at a nearby café. (The task is known to be completed when the lunch expense is successfully recorded in the app with all relevant details filled in)

I performed the action you suggested. However, I got the following critique for my actions so far: 
> Criticizer: "Jade Green is experiencing confusion with the app's UI and has navigated back multiple times, indicating difficulty in finding the correct options to record the expense. Jade Green needs to explore the dropdown field labeled "資產" to select the appropriate asset type for recording the lunch expense." 
Considering the critique, what should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a checked button that has text "帳戶"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a dropdown field that has text "食物"

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, the dropdown field labeled "類別" has expanded to reveal a list of buttons, with "食物" now marked as the selected option. Additional options such as "交通," "運動," "生活用品," and "其他" are now visible for the user to choose from. What should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):
```json
{
  page_name: AddOrEdit,
  children: [
    {
      ID: 3,
      widget_type: CheckedTextView,
      text: 食物,
      state: [
        checked
      ],
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      ID: 4,
      widget_type: CheckedTextView,
      text: 交通,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      ID: 5,
      widget_type: CheckedTextView,
      text: 運動,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      ID: 6,
      widget_type: CheckedTextView,
      text: 生活用品,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      ID: 7,
      widget_type: CheckedTextView,
      text: 其他,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    }
  ]
}
```

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- Focus on completing your SPECIFIC TASK, not exploring new widgets
- If you are stuck or confused while trying to complete the task, report the problem:
  * "I cannot find the option for [what you're looking for]"
  * "The UI is unclear about [specific confusion point]"
  * "I expected to see [something] but found [something else]"
- If the task seems impossible to complete with current UI state, explain why and suggest giving up

Recall that my current task is: Record a USD 15 lunch expense at a nearby café.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: I have successfully navigated to the AddOrEdit page and selected the "食物" category for my lunch expense. However, I have faced confusion with the app's UI, leading to multiple navigations back and forth.
2. Description of the current app state: The dropdown field labeled "類別" has expanded, showing that "食物" is selected, while other options such as "交通," "運動," "生活用品," and "其他" are also visible.
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: After confirming the category, I still need to add details like the location of the expense and finalize the entry to record the lunch expense.
4. Reasoning for the next action: Since the category selection is complete, the next logical step is to find and touch on a button that allows me to confirm or save this expense entry to proceed with the task.

*** User:
