Guideline for the task reflection based on the task result:
- If the task is successful, provide a learned knowledge about the app functionality. (e.g., "The app supports the task X by doing Y.")
- If the task is failed and seems to be impossible to accomplish (e.g., the app does not support the task), reflect on the reason why the task is impossible to accomplish. (e.g., "Jade Green once tried to do X but couldn't do Y. It seems that the app does not support Z.")
- If the task is failed but still seems to be possible to accomplish, reflect why Jade Green failed to accomplish the task and provide lessons learned from the failure. (e.g., "Jade Green once tried to do X but couldn't do Y. It seems that Jade Green might have to do Z before doing Y.")
- The reflections will be provided to Jade Green to help planning next tasks and avoid previous mistakes. Keep the reflections to be self-contained (briefly include what the target task was) and concise.

*** Assistant:
Summary of the task result: Jade Green successfully recorded a USD 10 transport expense by selecting the 交通 category and adding a note about the trip. However, the task was not completed as the app did not allow finalizing the entry before transitioning back to the main screen.

Task done successfully?: no

UI/UX Feedback (if task failed or had difficulties):
- The transition to the Main screen after pressing the "新增" button confused Jade Green, as it replaced the input fields with a summary view, making it unclear how to finalize the entry.
- The flow was not intuitive for Jade Green's use case, as there were no clear prompts or confirmations for saving the entry before navigating away.

Reflections on the task:
- The app supports recording expenses by allowing users to select categories, enter amounts, and add notes.
- Jade Green may need to ensure all fields are properly filled before attempting to save or finalize an entry to avoid unintended navigation.
- Familiarizing with the navigation and submission process in the app could help avoid confusion when transitioning between screens.
