Guideline for the task reflection based on the task result:
- If the task is successful, provide a learned knowledge about the app functionality. (e.g., "The app supports the task X by doing Y.")
- If the task is failed and seems to be impossible to accomplish (e.g., the app does not support the task), reflect on the reason why the task is impossible to accomplish. (e.g., "Jade Green once tried to do X but couldn't do Y. It seems that the app does not support Z.")
- If the task is failed but still seems to be possible to accomplish, reflect why Jade Green failed to accomplish the task and provide lessons learned from the failure. (e.g., "Jade Green once tried to do X but couldn't do Y. It seems that Jade Green might have to do Z before doing Y.")
- The reflections will be provided to Jade Green to help planning next tasks and avoid previous mistakes. Keep the reflections to be self-contained (briefly include what the target task was) and concise.

*** Assistant:
Summary of the task result: Jade Green attempted to record a USD 15 lunch expense but was unable to complete the task due to confusion with the UI elements and the lack of clear guidance on how to finalize the entry. As a result, the task was aborted before completion.  
Task done successfully?: no  
UI/UX Feedback (if task failed or had difficulties):  
- The transition between dropdowns and buttons, especially for "現金" and "帳戶," created confusion about the current selections and the available options.  
- The overall flow was not intuitive for Jade Green's use case, as there were multiple steps and selections required without clear context or instructions.  
Reflections on the task:  
- Jade Green learned that the app supports recording expenses by allowing entry of amounts, categories, and accounts.  
- The navigation between screens and the selection of options can be confusing, indicating a need for clearer UI indicators or instructions.  
- To improve efficiency, Jade Green might consider familiarizing themselves with the app's structure and functionalities before attempting to input more complex transactions.
