- user_segment: "Power User"
- typical_tasks: ["Add expense in different currencies", "Generate expense reports", "Manage multiple accounts"]
- pain_points_to_watch: ["Slow currency switching", "Complicated report filters", "Too many clicks for common tasks"]
- natural_behaviors: Jade Green is a busy student who records expenses regularly (meals, transport, study materials), may use multiple currencies when traveling, wants to analyze spending patterns, and manages different financial accounts for different purposes.
- task_completion_rule: Each task is ONE COMPLETE workflow from start to finish. Do NOT split a workflow into multiple separate tasks. Do NOT repeat the same workflow multiple times unless testing different variations.

CRITICAL: Your role is to help Jade Green COMPLETE the planned task, not to explore the app randomly.
- You have a specific goal to achieve
- You must work directly toward this goal
- Do NOT try alternative options or explore unrelated features unless necessary
- When you encounter choices, pick the one that matches your goal

Jade Green can perform the following types of actions:
- Scroll on a scrollable widget
- Touch on a clickable widget
- Long touch on a long-clickable widget
- Fill in an editable widget
- Navigate back by pressing the back button
- End the task when your specific goal is completed

*** User:
My name is Jade Green and I am using an application named 記帳小助手 to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Record a USD 10 transport expense by selecting the 交通 category, entering the amount, and adding a note about the trip. (The task is known to be completed when the transport expense is successfully recorded, showing the amount and category in the expense list)

I'm currently on the AddOrEdit page. What should be the first action?

Touch on a button that has text "交通"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. However, I got the following critique for my actions so far: 
> Criticizer: "Jade Green has successfully selected the 交通 category and entered the amount and a note, but seems to be struggling to find the submit option to record the expense. Jade Green needs to select the button labeled "新增" to submit the expense entry and complete the task." 
Considering the critique, what should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "新增"

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, after touching the button labeled "新增," the screen transitioned to the Main page, where new buttons and text views displaying financial information such as income, expenses, and totals were introduced. The previous input fields and options for adding details have been replaced with a summary view, which may confuse users expecting to continue entering data. (page changed from AddOrEdit to Main). What should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):

```

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- Focus on completing your SPECIFIC TASK, not exploring new widgets
- If you are stuck or confused while trying to complete the task, report the problem:
  * "I cannot find the option for [what you're looking for]"
  * "The UI is unclear about [specific confusion point]"
  * "I expected to see [something] but found [something else]"
- If the task seems impossible to complete with current UI state, explain why and suggest giving up

Recall that my current task is: Record a USD 10 transport expense by selecting the 交通 category, entering the amount, and adding a note about the trip.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: I have successfully selected the 交通 category, entered the amount of 10, and added a note about the trip. However, I have not yet found the option to submit the expense entry to complete the task.
2. Description of the current app state: I am currently on the Main page, which displays financial information such as income, expenses, and totals, along with a summary view of recent transactions.
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: To complete the task, I need to find a way to return to the AddOrEdit page to submit the recorded expense, as the current page does not provide an option for that.
4. Reasoning for the next action: The most logical action is to touch the button with resource_id "adder" to return to the AddOrEdit page, where I can finalize and submit the expense entry.

*** User:
Based on your reasoning, select the next action or end the task by calling one of the given function that corresponds to a specific action.
