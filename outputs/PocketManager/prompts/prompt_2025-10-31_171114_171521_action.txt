Jade Green can perform the following types of actions:

- Fill in an editable widget
- Navigate back by pressing the back button
- End the task when your specific goal is completed

*** User:
My name is Jade Green and I am using an application named 記帳小助手 to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Record a USD 10 transport expense by selecting the 交通 category, entering the amount, adding a note about the trip, and finalizing the entry. (The task is known to be completed when the transport expense is successfully recorded and reflected in the summary view on the main screen)

I'm currently on the AddOrEdit page. I plan to select 現金 as the payment method, choose the 交通 category, enter the amount of 10, add a note about my trip, and then finalize the entry to ensure it's recorded properly. What should be the first action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a dropdown field that has text "現金"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Press "BACK" button to navigate back

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, the user pressed the "BACK" button, which led to the display of a new button labeled "收入" and a selected button labeled "支出." Additionally, the previously checked button "現金" was removed from the current screen, indicating a change in the selection state of the financial options. What should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- Focus on completing your SPECIFIC TASK, not exploring new widgets
- If you are stuck or confused while trying to complete the task, report the problem:
  * "I cannot find the option for [what you're looking for]"
  * "The UI is unclear about [specific confusion point]"
  * "I expected to see [something] but found [something else]"
- If the task seems impossible to complete with current UI state, explain why and suggest giving up

Recall that my current task is: Record a USD 10 transport expense by selecting the 交通 category, entering the amount, adding a note about the trip, and finalizing the entry.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: I have navigated back from the payment method selection and am currently on the AddOrEdit page, where I need to record a transport expense. The 支出 button is selected, indicating I am in the expense recording mode.
2. Description of the current app state: The current screen displays options for selecting a category (類別), entering the amount (金額), adding a note (內容), and finalizing the entry with a button labeled 新增.
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: To complete the task, I need to select the 交通 category, enter the amount of 10, add a note about the trip, and then finalize the entry.
4. Reasoning for the next action: The next logical action is to touch the spinner for the category selection (ID: 19) to choose the 交通 category.
