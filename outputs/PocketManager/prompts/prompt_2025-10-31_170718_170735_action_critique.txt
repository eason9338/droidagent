Guideline for criticizing the actions:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary, the widget has not been interacted yet.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore the new widgets that have not been used and doesn't know the role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.
