Jade Green can perform the following types of actions:

*** User:
My name is Jade Green and I am using an application named 記帳小助手 to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Record a USD 15 lunch expense at a nearby café. (The task is known to be completed when the lunch expense is successfully recorded in the app with all relevant details filled in)

I'm currently on the Main page. I plan to record a USD 15 lunch expense at a nearby café to keep track of my daily spending and analyze my eating-out habits. What should be the first action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has resource_id "adder"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Open the app again because the previous action led to closing the app

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Press "BACK" button to navigate back

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Open the app again because the previous action led to closing the app

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, after pressing the "BACK" button, the current screen now displays a text view with the message "還沒有資料喔~" indicating that no data is available, along with several buttons and text views related to financial tracking, which were not present on the previous screen. This change may be confusing for users as it shifts from a main app interface to a more specific financial summary without clear context. What should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):
```json
{
  page_name: Main,
  children: [
    {
      ID: 6,
      widget_type: ViewPager,
      resource_id: view_pager,
      possible_action_types: [
        scroll
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0,
      children: [
        {
          widget_type: TextView,
          text: 還沒有資料喔~
        },
        {
          ID: 9,
          widget_type: ImageButton,
          resource_id: lastMonth,
          possible_action_types: [
            touch
          ],
          num_prev_actions: 0
        },
        {
          ID: 10,
          widget_type: Button,
          text: 2025 10月,
          possible_action_types: [
            touch
          ],
          num_prev_actions: 0
        },
        {
          ID: 11,
          widget_type: ImageButton,
          resource_id: nextMonth,
          possible_action_types: [
            touch
          ],
          num_prev_actions: 0
        },
        {
          widget_type: TextView,
          text: 收入
        },
        {
          widget_type: TextView,
          text: 0
        },
        {
          widget_type: TextView,
          text: 支出
        },
        {
          widget_type: TextView,
          text: 0
        },
        {
          widget_type: TextView,
          text: 總額
        },
        {
          widget_type: TextView,
          text: 0
        },
        {
          ID: 23,
          widget_type: ImageButton,
          resource_id: adder,
          possible_action_types: [
            touch
          ],
          num_prev_actions: 2,
          widget_role_inference: The widget serves as a button that, when touched, opens a new interface displaying buttons and widgets such as Play Store, Gmail, and Photos, while replacing the previous financial summary view.
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      widget_type: TextView,
      text: 帳單,
      state: [
        selected
      ]
    },
    {
      ID: 36,
      widget_type: LinearLayout,
      text: 圖表,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      ID: 39,
      widget_type: LinearLayout,
      text: 設定,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    }
  ]
}
```

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- Focus on completing your SPECIFIC TASK, not exploring new widgets
- If you are stuck or confused while trying to complete the task, report the problem:
  * "I cannot find the option for [what you're looking for]"
  * "The UI is unclear about [specific confusion point]"
  * "I expected to see [something] but found [something else]"
- If the task seems impossible to complete with current UI state, explain why and suggest giving up

Recall that my current task is: Record a USD 15 lunch expense at a nearby café.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: I attempted to add a new expense but encountered a screen indicating "還沒有資料喔~" and various financial summary options instead of the expected interface for recording expenses. 
2. Description of the current app state: The app is currently displaying a financial summary with no data, along with buttons for navigating months and options for adding new entries. 
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: I need to find and interact with the adder button to proceed to the expense recording interface, as this button seems to be the way to access the function I need. 
4. Reasoning for the next action: I will touch the button with resource_id "adder" to open the interface for recording my lunch expense, as it is the logical next step toward completing my task.
