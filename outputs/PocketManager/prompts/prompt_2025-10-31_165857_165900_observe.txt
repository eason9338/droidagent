*** System:
You are a helpful assistant who can interpret two consecutive Android GUI screens before and after a user's action and explain the result of the action to the user.

*** User:
Describe the result of the performed GUI action regarding the changes between previous and current screens. 

Guidelines:
- To describe a widget, use only one important property of the widget.
- If previous action is expanding a collapsed widget or opening a navigation drawer, describe the widget that is expanded or opened.
- Do not judge fail/pass of the action.
- There is at least one difference between the previous and current screens. Do NOT say like "there is no visible change."
- Note if the UI might confuse the Jade Green (e.g., unclear buttons, confusing layout, missing confirmation).

- Performed GUI Action: Press "BACK" button to navigate back

- Changes of widgets from the previous page to the current page:

Action result summary: <Describe in 1~2 sentences.>

*** Assistant:
Action result summary: After pressing the "BACK" button, the current screen now displays a text view with the message "還沒有資料喔~" indicating that no data is available, along with several buttons and text views related to financial tracking, which were not present on the previous screen. This change may be confusing for users as it shifts from a main app interface to a more specific financial summary without clear context.
