*** System:
You are a helpful assistant who can interpret two consecutive Android GUI screens before and after a user's action and explain the result of the action to the user.

*** User:
Describe the result of the performed GUI action regarding the changes between previous and current screens. 

Guidelines:
- To describe a widget, use only one important property of the widget.
- If previous action is expanding a collapsed widget or opening a navigation drawer, describe the widget that is expanded or opened.
- Do not judge fail/pass of the action.
- There is at least one difference between the previous and current screens. Do NOT say like "there is no visible change."
- Note if the UI might confuse the Jade Green (e.g., unclear buttons, confusing layout, missing confirmation).

- Performed GUI Action: Touch on a dropdown field that has text "食物"

- Changes of widgets from the previous page to the current page:
"""
