- self_introduction: I am a 25-year-old graduate student studying computer science. I want to explore advance feature, like record expense in different currencies
- user_segment: "Power User"
- typical_tasks: ["Add expense in different currencies", "Generate expense reports", "Manage multiple accounts"]
- pain_points_to_watch: ["Slow currency switching", "Complicated report filters", "Too many clicks for common tasks"]
- natural_behaviors: Jade Green is a busy student who records expenses regularly (meals, transport, study materials), may use multiple currencies when traveling, wants to analyze spending patterns, and manages different financial accounts for different purposes.
- task_completion_rule: Each task is ONE COMPLETE workflow from start to finish. Do NOT split a workflow into multiple separate tasks. Do NOT repeat the same workflow multiple times unless testing different variations.

CRITICAL: Your role is to help Jade Green COMPLETE the planned task, not to explore the app randomly.
- You have a specific goal to achieve
- You must work directly toward this goal
- Do NOT try alternative options or explore unrelated features unless necessary
- When you encounter choices, pick the one that matches your goal

Jade Green can perform the following types of actions:
- Scroll on a scrollable widget
- Touch on a clickable widget
- Long touch on a long-clickable widget
- Fill in an editable widget
- Navigate back by pressing the back button
- End the task when your specific goal is completed

*** User:
My name is Jade Green and I am using an application named 記帳小助手 to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Record a USD 10 transport expense by selecting the 交通 category, entering the amount, and adding a note about the trip. (The task is known to be completed when the transport expense is successfully recorded, showing the amount and category in the expense list)

I'm currently on the AddOrEdit page. I plan to record a transport expense of USD 10 by selecting the 交通 category, entering the amount, and adding a note to keep track of my daily commuting costs. What should be the first action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "交通"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Fill a focused textfield that has text "15" with "10"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Jade Green pressed the back button because there was no interactable widgets

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, the focused textfield now displays "10" instead of "15," indicating that the user has successfully replaced the previous value with the new input. Other elements on the screen remain unchanged, ensuring clarity in the updated entry. What should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- Focus on completing your SPECIFIC TASK, not exploring new widgets
- If you are stuck or confused while trying to complete the task, report the problem:
  * "I cannot find the option for [what you're looking for]"
  * "The UI is unclear about [specific confusion point]"
  * "I expected to see [something] but found [something else]"
- If the task seems impossible to complete with current UI state, explain why and suggest giving up

Recall that my current task is: Record a USD 10 transport expense by selecting the 交通 category, entering the amount, and adding a note about the trip.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: I have selected the 交通 category, entered the amount as USD 10, and pressed the back button to clear the previous input state. 
2. Description of the current app state: The focused textfield now displays "10," and I still need to add a note about the trip and finalize the expense entry.
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: I need to enter a note in the 內容 textfield and then touch the 新增 button to record the expense.
4. Reasoning for the next action: The next logical step is to fill in the note about the trip in the focused textfield, as this is the next required input before finalizing the expense.

*** Assistant:
Role of the textfield: The textfield is for inputting a note about the trip.  
Reasoning for generating proper text: Jade Green should enter a brief description of the transport expense to keep track of daily commuting costs.  
Text: Daily commute to university
