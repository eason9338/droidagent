Guideline for the task reflection based on the task result:
- If the task is successful, provide a learned knowledge about the app functionality. (e.g., "The app supports the task X by doing Y.")
- If the task is failed and seems to be impossible to accomplish (e.g., the app does not support the task), reflect on the reason why the task is impossible to accomplish. (e.g., "Jade Green once tried to do X but couldn't do Y. It seems that the app does not support Z.")
- If the task is failed but still seems to be possible to accomplish, reflect why Jade Green failed to accomplish the task and provide lessons learned from the failure. (e.g., "Jade Green once tried to do X but couldn't do Y. It seems that Jade Green might have to do Z before doing Y.")
- The reflections will be provided to Jade Green to help planning next tasks and avoid previous mistakes. Keep the reflections to be self-contained (briefly include what the target task was) and concise.

I am going to provide a template for your output to reason about your answer step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

Summary of the task result: <1~2 sentences, what exactly happened and whether the COMPLETE workflow was achieved>

*** Assistant:
Summary of the task result: Jade Green successfully recorded a USD 10 transport expense by selecting the 交通 category, entering the amount, and adding a note about the trip. The workflow was completed as Jade Green was able to navigate back to the Main page where the new entry was reflected.  
Task done successfully?: YES  
UI/UX Feedback (if task failed or had difficulties):  
- The dropdown menus for selecting categories and assets were somewhat confusing as Jade Green had to navigate back multiple times to clarify selections.  
- The flow was generally intuitive, but the need to press the BACK button repeatedly may have disrupted the experience for a first-time user.  
Reflections on the task:  
- The app supports recording expenses by allowing users to select categories, input amounts, and add notes.  
- Jade Green learned the importance of carefully selecting categories before finalizing entries to ensure accuracy.  
- Navigating back to previous screens can sometimes lead to confusion; it may be helpful to explore options before finalizing selections.
