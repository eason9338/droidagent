*** User:
My name is Jade Green and I am using an application named 記帳小助手 to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Record a USD 10 transport expense by selecting the 交通 category, entering the amount, and adding a note about the trip. (The task is known to be completed when the transport expense is successfully recorded, showing the amount and category in the expense list)

I performed the action you suggested. However, I got the following critique for my actions so far: 
> Criticizer: "Jade Green has successfully selected the 交通 category and entered the amount and a note, but seems to be struggling to find the submit option to record the expense. Jade Green needs to select the button labeled "新增" to submit the expense entry and complete the task." 
Considering the critique, what should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "新增"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. The page changed from AddOrEdit to Main. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has resource_id "adder"

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, after touching the button with resource_id "adder," the user is taken to the "AddOrEdit" screen, which introduces new fields for entering details such as date, amount, and content, along with buttons for saving the entry. The previous screen's widgets have been replaced with forms and dropdowns, indicating a transition to a data entry mode. (page changed from Main to AddOrEdit). What should be the next action?

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- Focus on completing your SPECIFIC TASK, not exploring new widgets
- If you are stuck or confused while trying to complete the task, report the problem:
  * "I cannot find the option for [what you're looking for]"
  * "The UI is unclear about [specific confusion point]"
  * "I expected to see [something] but found [something else]"
- If the task seems impossible to complete with current UI state, explain why and suggest giving up

Recall that my current task is: Record a USD 10 transport expense by selecting the 交通 category, entering the amount, and adding a note about the trip.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: I have successfully selected the 交通 category, entered the amount of 10, and added a note about the trip. However, I need to find the submit option to record the expense.
2. Description of the current app state: I am on the AddOrEdit page, where I can input details for the expense, including the date, amount, category, and notes, with the option to submit the entry.
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: I need to ensure the category is set to 交通, verify the amount is 10, add a note, and then find the button to submit the expense.
4. Reasoning for the next action: The next logical action is to touch the button labeled "交通" again to confirm my selection for the category before submitting the expense.

*** User:
