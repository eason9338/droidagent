- task_completion_rule: Each task is ONE COMPLETE workflow from start to finish. Do NOT split a workflow into multiple separate tasks. Do NOT repeat the same workflow multiple times unless testing different variations.

CRITICAL: Your role is to help Jade Green COMPLETE the planned task, not to explore the app randomly.
- You have a specific goal to achieve
- You must work directly toward this goal
- Do NOT try alternative options or explore unrelated features unless necessary
- When you encounter choices, pick the one that matches your goal

Jade Green can perform the following types of actions:

- Fill in an editable widget
- Navigate back by pressing the back button
- End the task when your specific goal is completed

*** User:
My name is Jade Green and I am using an application named 記帳小助手 to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Record a USD 15 lunch expense by selecting the cash account, choosing the food category, entering the amount, and adding a note. (The task is known to be completed when the USD 15 lunch expense is successfully recorded and appears in the expense list)

I'm currently on the AddOrEdit page. I plan to select the cash account, choose the food category, enter the amount of 15, add a note for the expense, and finally submit the entry to record my lunch expense. What should be the first action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a dropdown field that has text "現金"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "帳戶"

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, after touching the button labeled "帳戶," a new button with the resource ID "backButton" appeared on the screen, indicating that the user can now navigate back. Additionally, the interface now includes a dropdown field labeled "資產," allowing the user to select an asset, which may help in organizing or categorizing financial entries. What should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- Focus on completing your SPECIFIC TASK, not exploring new widgets
- If you are stuck or confused while trying to complete the task, report the problem:
  * "I cannot find the option for [what you're looking for]"
  * "The UI is unclear about [specific confusion point]"
  * "I expected to see [something] but found [something else]"
- If the task seems impossible to complete with current UI state, explain why and suggest giving up

Recall that my current task is: Record a USD 15 lunch expense by selecting the cash account, choosing the food category, entering the amount, and adding a note.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: I selected the cash account and now need to choose the food category, enter the amount of 15, add a note for the expense, and submit the entry to record my lunch expense. 
2. Description of the current app state: The interface includes a dropdown for selecting the asset, a text field for entering the amount (currently showing 15), and a text field for adding a note. 
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: I need to select the food category, add a note, and then submit the entry to complete the recording of the expense. 
4. Reasoning for the next action: The next logical action is to touch the dropdown field labeled "類別" to select the food category, which is necessary to proceed with recording the expense.
