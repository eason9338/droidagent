Past interactions on the widget:
- result of touch: The button labeled "現金" remains present on the current screen, while the previously selected button "帳戶" is no longer checked, indicating a change in the selection state. Additionally, new buttons and dropdown fields related to income and expense categories have been introduced, which may cause confusion for users trying to navigate the options.

If it seems that interacting the widget introduces a new page or widgets, try to include the name of the page or widgets in your answer. (e.g., The widget expands new options X, Y, Z, the widget opens a new page P, etc.) Do not include anything else except the description of the widget role in your answer.

*** Assistant:
The widget allows the user to select "現金" (cash) as a payment method, which changes the selection state from "帳戶" (account) and introduces new buttons and dropdown fields related to income and expense categories on the current screen.
