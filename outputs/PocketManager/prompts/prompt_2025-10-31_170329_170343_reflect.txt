Guideline for the task reflection based on the task result:
- If the task is successful, provide a learned knowledge about the app functionality. (e.g., "The app supports the task X by doing Y.")
- If the task is failed and seems to be impossible to accomplish (e.g., the app does not support the task), reflect on the reason why the task is impossible to accomplish. (e.g., "Jade Green once tried to do X but couldn't do Y. It seems that the app does not support Z.")
- If the task is failed but still seems to be possible to accomplish, reflect why Jade Green failed to accomplish the task and provide lessons learned from the failure. (e.g., "Jade Green once tried to do X but couldn't do Y. It seems that Jade Green might have to do Z before doing Y.")
- The reflections will be provided to Jade Green to help planning next tasks and avoid previous mistakes. Keep the reflections to be self-contained (briefly include what the target task was) and concise.
