- user_segment: "Power User"
- typical_tasks: ["Add expense in different currencies", "Generate expense reports", "Manage multiple accounts"]
- pain_points_to_watch: ["Slow currency switching", "Complicated report filters", "Too many clicks for common tasks"]
- natural_behaviors: Jade Green is a busy student who records expenses regularly (meals, transport, study materials), may use multiple currencies when traveling, wants to analyze spending patterns, and manages different financial accounts for different purposes.
- task_completion_rule: Each task is ONE COMPLETE workflow from start to finish. Do NOT split a workflow into multiple separate tasks. Do NOT repeat the same workflow multiple times unless testing different variations.

CRITICAL: Your role is to help Jade Green COMPLETE the planned task, not to explore the app randomly.
- You have a specific goal to achieve
- You must work directly toward this goal
- Do NOT try alternative options or explore unrelated features unless necessary
- When you encounter choices, pick the one that matches your goal

Jade Green can perform the following types of actions:
- Scroll on a scrollable widget
- Touch on a clickable widget
- Long touch on a long-clickable widget
- Fill in an editable widget
- Navigate back by pressing the back button
- End the task when your specific goal is completed

*** User:
My name is Jade Green and I am using an application named 記帳小助手 to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Record a USD 10 transport expense by selecting the 交通 category, entering the amount, adding a note about the trip, and finalizing the entry. (The task is known to be completed when the transport expense is successfully recorded and reflected in the summary view on the main screen)

I'm currently on the AddOrEdit page. I plan to select 現金 as the payment method, choose the 交通 category, enter the amount of 10, add a note about my trip, and then finalize the entry to ensure it's recorded properly. What should be the first action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a dropdown field that has text "現金"

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, the dropdown field labeled "資產" has been expanded to show the available options, and the previously selected option "現金" is now marked as checked. Additionally, a new button labeled "帳戶" has appeared, indicating that there are more selection options related to assets. What should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):
```json
{
  page_name: AddOrEdit,
  children: [
    {
      ID: 3,
      widget_type: CheckedTextView,
      text: 現金,
      state: [
        checked
      ],
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 2,
      widget_role_inference: The widget allows users to select the payment method 現金 (cash), changing the selection state from the previously selected 帳戶 (account), and introduces new buttons and dropdown fields related to income and expense categories on the current screen.
    },
    {
      ID: 4,
      widget_type: CheckedTextView,
      text: 帳戶,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 6,
      widget_role_inference: The widget expands new options such as the buttons 收入 and 支出, introduces a dropdown field labeled 資產, and allows navigation back with a button labeled backButton, indicating its role in managing account-related transactions.
    }
  ]
}
```

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- Focus on completing your SPECIFIC TASK, not exploring new widgets
- If you are stuck or confused while trying to complete the task, report the problem:
  * "I cannot find the option for [what you're looking for]"
  * "The UI is unclear about [specific confusion point]"
  * "I expected to see [something] but found [something else]"
- If the task seems impossible to complete with current UI state, explain why and suggest giving up

Recall that my current task is: Record a USD 10 transport expense by selecting the 交通 category, entering the amount, adding a note about the trip, and finalizing the entry.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: I have selected "現金" as the payment method, and the dropdown for "資產" has expanded to show my selection. 
2. Description of the current app state: The current app state shows that "現金" is marked as checked, and there is an option labeled "帳戶" which introduces new category selections.
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: I still need to select the "交通" category, enter the amount of 10, add a note about the trip, and finalize the entry to record the expense.
4. Reasoning for the next action: The next logical action is to select the "交通" category, so I will need to find and touch the appropriate category option for transportation.
