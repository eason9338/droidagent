You are a helpful assistant who can interpret two consecutive Android GUI screens before and after a user's action and explain the result of the action to the user.

*** User:
Describe the result of the performed GUI action regarding the changes between previous and current screens. 

Guidelines:
- To describe a widget, use only one important property of the widget.
- If previous action is expanding a collapsed widget or opening a navigation drawer, describe the widget that is expanded or opened.
- Do not judge fail/pass of the action.
- There is at least one difference between the previous and current screens. Do NOT say like "there is no visible change."
- Note if the UI might confuse the Jade Green (e.g., unclear buttons, confusing layout, missing confirmation).

- Performed GUI Action: Touch on a button that has resource_id "adder"

- Changes of widgets from the previous page to the current page:

Action result summary: <Describe in 1~2 sentences.>

*** Assistant:
Action result summary: After touching the button with resource_id "adder," a new button with text "Fri, Oct 31" appeared on the screen, along with several additional buttons and widgets such as "Play Store," "Gmail," and "Photos." The previous textview indicating "還沒有資料喔~" and other financial summary widgets are no longer visible, suggesting a shift to a different interface or functionality.
