Task execution history so far (listed in chronological order):
===
16:57:55:Main: [ACTION] Jade Green touched on a button that has resource_id "adder"
16:58:30:Main: [ACTION] Open the app again because the previous action led to closing the app
16:58:33:Main: [OBSERVATION] After touching the button with resource_id "adder," a new button with text "Fri, Oct 31" appeared on the screen, along with several additional buttons and widgets such as "Play Store," "Gmail," and "Photos." The previous textview indicating "還沒有資料喔~" and other financial summary widgets are no longer visible, suggesting a shift to a different interface or functionality.
16:58:40:Main: [ACTION] Jade Green pressed "BACK" button to navigate back
16:58:58:Main: [ACTION] Open the app again because the previous action led to closing the app

Widgets in current page:

      widget_role_inference: The widget allows users to select different account types, expanding new options such as 收入 and 支出, and introduces a dropdown field labeled 資產 along with transaction detail inputs based on the selected account type.
    }
  ]
}
```
Guideline for criticizing the actions:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary, the widget has not been interacted yet.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore the new widgets that have not been used and doesn't know the role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

*** Assistant:

Need a workaround plan?: yes  
Workaround plan for Jade Green: Jade Green needs to explore the dropdown fields and options available on the AddOrEdit screen to select the correct account and category for the lunch expense, and ensure to fill in all required fields before submitting the expense.
