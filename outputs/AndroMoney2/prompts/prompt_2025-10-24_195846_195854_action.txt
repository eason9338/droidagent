*** User:
My name is Jade Green and I am using an application named AndroMoney to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Touch the AndroMoney icon to open the app. (The task is known to be completed when the AndroMoney app is successfully opened)

I'm currently on the NexusLauncher page. What should be the first action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "AndroMoney"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has content_desc "Navigate up"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. The page changed from AboutUs to HomeRecord. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has content_desc "More options"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "Summary"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. However, I got the following critique for my actions so far: 
> Criticizer: "Jade Green successfully navigated through the app but did not directly open the AndroMoney app after touching its icon; instead, they landed on the About Us page. Jade Green needs to touch the "AndroMoney" button again in the Home Record screen to return to the main interface of the application." 
Considering the critique, what should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has content_desc "AndroMoney"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has content_desc "Sync database"

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, the action of touching the button labeled "Sync database" has transitioned the user from the HomeRecord screen to the SimpleDialogAccountPicker screen, where a new textview displaying "Choose account for AndroMoney" has appeared, indicating that the user is now prompted to select an account for synchronization. Additionally, options to add an account or cancel the action are now available. What should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):
```json
{
  page_name: SimpleDialogAccountPicker,
  children: [
    {
      widget_type: TextView,
      text: Choose account for AndroMoney
    },
    {
      ID: 16,
      widget_type: CheckedTextView,
      text: Add account,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      ID: 19,
      widget_type: Button,
      text: CANCEL,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    }
  ]
}
```

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore a new widget that has not been used and I don't know its role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

Recall that my current task is: Touch the AndroMoney icon to open the app.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: Jade Green has navigated through the app but did not directly open the AndroMoney app; instead, they ended up on the SimpleDialogAccountPicker screen after attempting to sync the database.
2. Description of the current app state: The current screen prompts Jade Green to choose an account for AndroMoney, with options to add a new account or cancel the action.
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: To complete the task of opening the AndroMoney app, Jade Green needs to either select an account or cancel to return to the main interface of the app.
4. Reasoning for the next action: Since the "Add account" option is a new widget that has not been interacted with yet, it is logical to explore this option to see if it leads to a way to open the app.

*** User:
Based on your reasoning, select the next action or end the task by calling one of the given function that corresponds to a specific action.
