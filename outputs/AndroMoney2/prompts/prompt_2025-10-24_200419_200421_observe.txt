Describe the result of the performed GUI action regarding the changes between previous and current screens. 

Guidelines:
- To describe a widget, use only one important property of the widget. 
- If previous action is expanding a collapsed widget or opening a navigation drawer, describe the widget that is expanded or opened. 
- Do not judge fail/pass of the action.
- There is at least one difference between the previous and current screens. Do NOT say like "there is no visible change."
