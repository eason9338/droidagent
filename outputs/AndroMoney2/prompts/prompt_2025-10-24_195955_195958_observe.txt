- There is at least one difference between the previous and current screens. Do NOT say like "there is no visible change."

Action result summary: <Describe in 1~2 sentences.>

*** Assistant:
Action result summary: The screen has transitioned to a new view where a button with the content description "AndroMoney" has been activated, resulting in the disappearance of several buttons and text views, including "Search," "Account," "Budget," "Category," "Report," "Share," "Comment," "Settings," "Export/Import," and "About Us." Additionally, the scrollable area with the resource ID "left_drawer_lv" is still present, indicating a change in the available options on the screen.
