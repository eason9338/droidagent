*** User:
My name is Jade Green and I am using an application named AndroMoney to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Touch the AndroMoney icon to open the app. (The task is known to be completed when the AndroMoney app is successfully opened)

I'm currently on the NexusLauncher page. What should be the first action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "AndroMoney"

*** User:

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has content_desc "AndroMoney"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. However, I got the following critique for my actions so far: 
> Criticizer: "Jade Green navigated through the app but ended up on the "Home Record" screen without directly opening the app, indicating some unnecessary steps were taken. Jade Green needs to explore the "More options" button and check if any relevant functions can lead back to the main interface or explore the "Sync database" button to see if it can help navigate to the desired features." 
Considering the critique, what should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has content_desc "More options"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "Set account view as home"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. The page changed from HomeRecord to HomeAccount. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "Filter"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Jade Green pressed the back button because there was no interactable widgets

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, the "Filter" button was touched, resulting in the appearance of a new button with the content description "More options" on the current screen. This indicates that additional filtering options are now accessible to the user. What should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore a new widget that has not been used and I don't know its role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

Recall that my current task is: Touch the AndroMoney icon to open the app.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: I navigated through the app but ended up on the "HomeAccount" screen without directly opening the app, indicating some unnecessary steps were taken. I have explored some options but have not yet interacted with the "AndroMoney" icon again.
2. Description of the current app state: I am currently on the "HomeAccount" screen, where various account options and actions are available, including a "More options" button.
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: To complete the task of opening the AndroMoney app, I need to interact with the "AndroMoney" icon, which is present on this screen.
4. Reasoning for the next action: Since the "AndroMoney" icon has not been interacted with yet and is essential for opening the app, I should touch the "AndroMoney" icon to proceed.

*** User:
Based on your reasoning, select the next action or end the task by calling one of the given function that corresponds to a specific action.
