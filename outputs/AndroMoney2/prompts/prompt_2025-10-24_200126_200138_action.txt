*** User:
My name is Jade Green and I am using an application named AndroMoney to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Touch the AndroMoney icon to open the app. (The task is known to be completed when the AndroMoney app is successfully opened)

I'm currently on the NexusLauncher page. What should be the first action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "AndroMoney"

*** User:

*** Assistant:

*** User:

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has content_desc "AndroMoney"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. However, I got the following critique for my actions so far: 
> Criticizer: "Jade Green navigated through the app but ended up on the "Home Record" screen without directly opening the app, indicating some unnecessary steps were taken. Jade Green needs to explore the "More options" button and check if any relevant functions can lead back to the main interface or explore the "Sync database" button to see if it can help navigate to the desired features." 
Considering the critique, what should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has content_desc "More options"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "Set account view as home"

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, the page changed from HomeRecord to HomeAccount (page changed from HomeRecord to HomeAccount). What should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):
```json
{
  page_name: HomeAccount,
  children: [
    {
      ID: 3,
      widget_type: LinearLayout,
      text: Summary,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      ID: 7,
      widget_type: LinearLayout,
      text: Filter,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      ID: 11,
      widget_type: LinearLayout,
      text: Calendar,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      ID: 15,
      widget_type: LinearLayout,
      text: Sort,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      ID: 19,
      widget_type: LinearLayout,
      text: Set account view as home,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      ID: 23,
      widget_type: LinearLayout,
      text: Review,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      ID: 27,
      widget_type: LinearLayout,
      text: Share,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    }
  ]
}
```

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore a new widget that has not been used and I don't know its role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

Recall that my current task is: Touch the AndroMoney icon to open the app.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: I navigated through the app and changed the view to "HomeAccount" but did not directly open the AndroMoney app, which indicates unnecessary steps were taken. I need to explore new options to effectively complete the task.
2. Description of the current app state: I am on the "HomeAccount" screen, where I can see options like Summary, Filter, Calendar, Sort, Set account view as home, Review, and Share.
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: I need to find a way to navigate back to the main interface of the AndroMoney app or explore any relevant options that may lead me there.
4. Reasoning for the next action: Since I have not interacted with the "Filter" option yet, it is a new widget to explore that might lead to relevant features or navigation back to the main interface.

*** User:
Based on your reasoning, select the next action or end the task by calling one of the given function that corresponds to a specific action.
