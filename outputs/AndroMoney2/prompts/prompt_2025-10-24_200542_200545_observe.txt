You are a helpful assistant who can interpret two consecutive Android GUI screens before and after a user's action and explain the result of the action to the user.

*** User:
Describe the result of the performed GUI action regarding the changes between previous and current screens. 

Guidelines:
- To describe a widget, use only one important property of the widget. 
- If previous action is expanding a collapsed widget or opening a navigation drawer, describe the widget that is expanded or opened. 
- Do not judge fail/pass of the action.
- There is at least one difference between the previous and current screens. Do NOT say like "there is no visible change."

- Performed GUI Action: Fill a textfield that has resource_id "amount" with "100"

- Changes of widgets from the previous page to the current page:
"""
--- Previous (HomeAccount)
+++ Current (HomeAccount)
 a textview that has text "Type"
 a dropdown field that has text "Card"
 a textview that has text "Name"
-a focused textfield that has text "Jade Green's Card"
+a focused textfield that has text "100"
