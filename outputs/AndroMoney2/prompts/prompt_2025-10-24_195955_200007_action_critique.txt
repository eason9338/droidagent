Guideline for criticizing the actions:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary, the widget has not been interacted yet.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore the new widgets that have not been used and doesn't know the role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

I am going to provide a template for your output to reason about your choice step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
Critique of task execution so far: <1~2 sentences in one line, say "okay" if everything seems fine.>
Need a workaround plan?: <yes/no, do not include any other word except "yes" or "no">
Workaround plan for Jade Green: <Start with "Jade Green needs to", and describe in one line. Say just "none" if Jade Green is doing well and no workaround is needed.>

*** Assistant:
Critique of task execution so far: Jade Green navigated through the app but ended up on the "Home Record" screen without directly opening the app, indicating some unnecessary steps were taken.  
Need a workaround plan?: yes  
Workaround plan for Jade Green: Jade Green needs to explore the "More options" button and check if any relevant functions can lead back to the main interface or explore the "Sync database" button to see if it can help navigate to the desired features.
