*** User:
My name is Jade Green and I am using an application named AndroMoney to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Touch the "New .." button. (The task is known to be completed when the new record entry screen appears)

I'm currently on the HomeAccount page. What should be the first action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has content_desc "New .."

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a dropdown field that has text "Cash"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "Card"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Fill a textfield that has resource_id "account_name" with "Jade Green's Card"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "US$"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "US$"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "US$"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Fill a textfield that has resource_id "amount" with "100"

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, the textfield with resource_id "amount" has been filled with the value "100," replacing the previously focused textfield that contained "Jade Green's Card." The current screen now shows the input of "100" in the specified textfield. However, I got the following critique for my actions so far: 
> Criticizer: "Jade Green has successfully navigated through the process of creating a new account and has filled in the account name and amount fields, but has repeated the action of touching the "US$" button without any apparent need. Jade Green needs to proceed by filling in the remaining fields, such as "Billing Date," "Payment Date," and "Notes," and then touch the "OK" button to complete the record entry." 
Considering the critique, what should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore a new widget that has not been used and I don't know its role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

Recall that my current task is: Touch the "New .." button.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: I have successfully filled in the account name and amount fields, but I repeated the action of touching the "US$" button unnecessarily. Now, I need to fill in the remaining fields like "Billing Date," "Payment Date," and "Notes" before completing the record entry.  
2. Description of the current app state: The current screen shows the input of "100" in the amount textfield, and there are additional fields for "Billing Date," "Payment Date," and "Notes" that have not been filled yet.  
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: I must fill in the "Billing Date," "Payment Date," and "Notes" fields, and then touch the "OK" button to finalize the record entry.  
4. Reasoning for the next action: The next logical action is to touch the textfield for "Billing Date" since it has not been interacted with yet and needs to be filled to continue completing the task.

*** User:
Based on your reasoning, select the next action or end the task by calling one of the given function that corresponds to a specific action.
