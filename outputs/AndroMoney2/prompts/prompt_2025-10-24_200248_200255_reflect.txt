Guideline for the task reflection based on the task result:
- If the task is successful, provide a learned knowledge about the app functionality. (e.g., "The app supports the task X by doing Y.")
- If the task is failed and seems to be impossible to accomplish (e.g., the app does not support the task), reflect on the reason why the task is impossible to accomplish. (e.g., "Jade Green once tried to do X but couldn't do Y. It seems that the app does not support Z.")
- If the task is failed but still seems to be possible to accomplish, reflect why Jade Green failed to accomplish the task and provide lessons learned from the failure. (e.g., "Jade Green once tried to do X but couldn't do Y. It seems that Jade Green might have to do Z before doing Y.")
- The reflections will be provided to Jade Green to help planning next tasks and avoid previous mistakes. Keep the reflections to be self-contained (briefly include what the target task was) and concise.

I am going to provide a template for your output to reason about your answer step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
Summary of the task result: <1~2 sentences, summary of the result of the task>

*** Assistant:
Summary of the task result: Jade Green successfully navigated through the AndroMoney app, starting from the "About Us" page to the "Home Account" page, exploring various functionalities along the way, but ultimately decided to abort the task due to its length.  
Task done successfully?: no  
Reflections on the task:  
- Jade Green learned that the app provides a detailed "About Us" section where users can find version information and details about the developers.  
- The navigation between pages is intuitive, but Jade Green might need to focus on more specific tasks to avoid lengthy transitions and unnecessary exploration.  
- The app offers various features such as account management and synchronization, which Jade Green can explore further in shorter, targeted sessions to enhance understanding.
