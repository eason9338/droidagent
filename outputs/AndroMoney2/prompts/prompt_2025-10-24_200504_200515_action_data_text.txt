Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore a new widget that has not been used and I don't know its role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

Recall that my current task is: Touch the "New .." button.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: You have touched the "New .." button and selected "Card" as the account type, and filled in the account name as "Jade Green's Card." You also selected the currency as "US$."
2. Description of the current app state: You are on the New Account screen, with fields for entering the initial amount, billing date, payment date, notes, and options to include in totals or cancel/confirm the entry.
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: You need to fill in the required fields to complete the new account entry, which includes entering the initial amount and other details.
4. Reasoning for the next action: The next logical action is to fill in the initial amount field, which has not been interacted with yet and is essential for completing the new account entry.

*** Assistant:
Role of the textfield: The textfield is for inputting the initial amount for the new account entry.  
Reasoning for generating proper text: Jade Green should input a reasonable initial amount reflecting their financial record, such as a typical starting balance for a card.  
Text: 100
